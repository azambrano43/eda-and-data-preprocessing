# Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing for Machine Learning

## Description
This repository is designed to provide easily accessible and reusable code for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing. The aim is to help users prepare their data effectively for machine learning, leaving the model construction to their discretion.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains sample datasets for analysis and preprocessing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing EDA and data cleaning processes.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data preparation and transformation.

## Requirements
To run the provided code, you'll need to have the following libraries installed:


    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Usage
You can reproduce the analysis by following these steps:

1. **Load data**: Place your data files in the `data/` folder.
2. **Reference analysis**: The `reference_analysis.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks/` folder provides a complete example of how to perform EDA and data preprocessing on the `flights.csv` dataset. Use it as a guide or reference for your own notebooks and datasets.
3. **Data cleaning and transformation**: Use the scripts in the `src/` folder to clean and preprocess your data.
4. **Model training**: This repository focuses on EDA and preprocessing; after preparing the data, you can proceed to build your own models.
