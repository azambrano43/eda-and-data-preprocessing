# Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing for Machine Learning

## Description
This repository is designed to provide easily accessible and reusable code for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing. The aim is to help users prepare their data effectively for machine learning, leaving the model construction to their discretion.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains sample datasets for analysis and preprocessing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing EDA and data cleaning processes.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data preparation and transformation.

## Requirements
To run the provided code, you'll need to have the following libraries installed:


    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Usage
You can reproduce the analysis by following these steps:

1. **Load data**: Place your data files in the `data/` folder.
2. **Data exploration**: Run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to perform EDA.
3. **Data cleaning and transformation**: Use the scripts in `src/` to clean and transform the data.
4. **Model training**: The focus here is on EDA and preprocessing, so you can use the cleaned data to build your own models.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome. If you have ideas or improvements, feel free to open a pull request or create an issue.
